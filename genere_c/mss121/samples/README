SAMPLES README for version 1.2 of MSS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains some sample files which can be compiled either
manually (linking with the latest version of the MSS library) or if you
are using GCC/DJGPP you can use the makefile provided.

It also contains some configuration file samples, mss.cfg and mssglobl.cfg.



Sample Programs:

These files were written for you to study and learn some of the capabilities
of MSS and how to use it for finding bugs.  Currently however there is a lack
of sample programs, and more will hopefully show up in a shortly. So don't
think that these sample files show ALL of the power in MSS. It merely shows
a tiny bit, but enough to get you started I think.


Sample 1: 'A simple and buggy String class'
          Shows some basic features of MSS and one way to use it to debug
          your programs making it easier to find tricky memory related bugs.
          Consists of three files: test1_1.cc, test1_2.cc and test1_3.cc.
          See test1.txt for more information.

Sample 2: 'How do I use MSS_LOG_BLOCK_LIST_FILTERED'
          The only purpose of this program is to show how the new feature
          (as of version 1.1 of MSS) MSS_LOG_BLOCK_LIST_FILTERED might be
          used. See test2.txt and the documentation for more information.
